% Always assume the sensor is to the right and the object world is to
% the left.
%
% To interpret the matrix, it is easiest to start at the bottom row and
% read up.
%
% The bottom row is a surface that initiates everything and thus its offset
% is always 0. The radius of curvature is the distance to the center of
% sphere, which is negative in this case. Thus, the surface is like a
% backwards 'C'.  The index of refraction is to the right of the surface
% and for the first surface it will generally be air (1).
%
% The next row up is 1.5 mm offset towards the next object. We have a 0
% radius object, which means it's an aperture.  The material between this
% position and the first surface is glass (N = 1.65).
%
% The third row up has a center to the right, so the shape is a 'C'.  The
% material is still glass. %
%
% In the lensC class, we don't use offsets. Instead, we store the sphere
% centers (sCenters) and radii (units of mm).  So here we go through the
% surfaceArray and produce the radius and offset needed for the PBRT matrix
% from the surfaceArray object sCenters and radius.
